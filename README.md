ðŸš€ Koodoo Automation Framework â€“ Final Story (Interview Version)

My framework is built on the Page Object Model (POM) architecture, ensuring a clear separation of concerns and high scalability.

In this design, Page classes define how the UI is interacted with (all element locators and actions), while Test classes define what to verify (business flows and assertions). The BaseClass manages all preconditions and postconditions, such as browser setup, teardown, environment initialization, and driver management â€” ensuring consistency across all test cases and reducing redundancy.

Iâ€™ve implemented key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts throughout the framework:

Abstraction: Implemented between the Page Layer and Test Layer. Tests donâ€™t worry about element locators or internal logic â€” they just call high-level reusable methods like loginToCRM() or clickSubmitButton().

Encapsulation: All WebElements are kept private inside the Page classes, exposing only public methods for interaction. This hides internal details and promotes modularity.

Inheritance: All test classes extend from BaseClass, inheriting common setup, teardown, and utility access.

Polymorphism: Achieved using the WebDriver interface â€” the same code runs seamlessly on Chrome, Edge, or Firefox, depending on configuration.

Composition: Classes like ConfigReader, HelperMethods, and ScreenshotUtil are used within other classes to provide modular functionality (like reading configs, capturing screenshots, or executing JS clicks).

The framework is divided into multiple logical layers, making it modular and easy to maintain:

Page Layer â€“ Contains all page classes and defines reusable UI actions.

Test Layer â€“ Holds TestNG-based test classes defining what to verify.

Base Layer â€“ Handles environment setup, browser management, and teardown.

Utilities Layer â€“ Includes reusable components such as ConfigReader, ExcelDataProvider, HelperMethods, and ScreenshotUtil.

Listeners Layer â€“ Implements ITestListener, IAnnotationTransformer, and RetryAnalyzer for capturing logs, retrying failed tests, and taking screenshots on failure.

Reporting Layer â€“ Uses both Extent Reports and Custom HTML Reports to present execution results with embedded screenshots for failed cases.

Configuration Layer â€“ Stores environment variables, URLs, and credentials for multiple test environments.

Iâ€™ve integrated custom TestNG listeners to handle logging, test retries, and screenshot capture automatically on test failures. The reporting mechanism merges Extent Reports and a Custom HTML Report, providing clear visual feedback of each run.

Finally, this framework is fully CI/CD-ready, integrated with GitHub and Jenkins pipelines, enabling automated execution, reporting, and test maintenance across environments.

Overall, this framework demonstrates clean OOP principles, modular architecture, and scalable design, supporting a complete end-to-end automation lifecycle â€” from execution to reporting.
